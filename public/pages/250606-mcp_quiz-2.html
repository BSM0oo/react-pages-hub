                options: [
                    "Standard Input/Output - a method for programs to communicate locally through text streams",

                ],
                correct: 0,
                explanation: "Stdio (Standard Input/Output) is how programs communicate locally on the same computer. In MCP servers, this means Claude sends commands through stdin and receives responses through stdout - like two programs passing notes back and forth. This is why local MCP servers work differently from remote ones."
            },
            {
                question: "What is the main difference between <span class='concept-highlight'>HTTP</span> and <span class='concept-highlight'>SSE</span> for MCP communication?",
                options: [
                    "HTTP is for web pages, SSE is for real-time data streaming",
                    "HTTP uses request-response cycles, SSE maintains open connections for continuous data flow",
                    "HTTP is encrypted, SSE is not encrypted",
                    "HTTP works locally, SSE works over the internet"
                ],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "HTTP follows a request-response pattern where each interaction is separate, while SSE (Server-Sent Events) keeps a connection open so the server can continuously send updates to the client. For AI conversations, SSE is better because it allows for real-time, back-and-forth communication."
            },
            {
                question: "Why can't you directly use a <span class='concept-highlight'>stdio-based MCP server</span> with a remote setup?",

                ],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Stdio (standard input/output) is designed for local program-to-program communication on the same machine. It can't travel across networks to remote servers. To make a stdio-based MCP server accessible remotely, you need to wrap it with an HTTP layer or use a proxy that converts stdio to network protocols."

                    "A programming language for web servers",
                    "A security protocol that lets users grant limited access without sharing passwords",

                ],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "OAuth is like giving someone a temporary, limited-access key card instead of your house key. It lets users authorize AI agents to access their services without sharing passwords, and they can control exactly what the agent can do. This is crucial for remote MCP servers that need to access user data securely."
            },
            {
                question: "In the context of MCP servers, what is a <span class='concept-highlight'>transport layer</span>?",

                    "The physical cables and hardware used for networking",
                    "The method used to carry MCP messages between client and server",
                    "The encryption algorithm used to secure data",
                    "The database where MCP configurations are stored"
                ],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "The transport layer is like the delivery method for MCP messages. Just as you can send a letter via postal mail, email, or text message, MCP messages can travel via different transport methods: stdio for local communication, HTTP for web requests, or SSE for real-time streaming."
            },
            {
                question: "What role does <span class='concept-highlight'>Cloudflare Tunnel</span> play in our MCP setup?",
                options: [
                    "It encrypts all MCP communications",
                    "It creates a secure pathway from the internet to your local servers",
                    "It stores backups of your MCP server configurations",

                ],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Cloudflare Tunnel is like a secure bridge that connects your local servers to the internet without opening ports on your firewall. It creates an outbound connection from your machine to Cloudflare, then Cloudflare can route internet traffic back through that tunnel to reach your local MCP servers safely."
            },
            {
                question: "Why might you need an <span class='concept-highlight'>MCP proxy</span> in a remote setup?",
                options: [
                    "To make stdio-based servers accessible via HTTP",
                    "To increase the speed of MCP communications",
                    "To provide backup storage for MCP data",
                    "To automatically update MCP server software"
                ],
                correct: 0,
                explanation: "An MCP proxy acts like a translator. Your existing MCP servers speak 'stdio' (local text-based communication), but remote setups need 'HTTP' (web-based communication). The proxy converts between these two languages, letting your local servers work in a remote environment without major changes."
            },
            {
                question: "What is the primary security benefit of using <span class='concept-highlight'>scoped permissions</span> in MCP servers?",
                options: [
                    "It makes the servers run faster",
                    "It prevents any single server from having too much access",
                    "It automatically backs up all data",
                    "It eliminates the need for user authentication"
                ],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Scoped permissions follow the 'principle of least privilege' - each MCP server only gets the minimum access it needs to do its job. It's like giving a house cleaner a key only to certain rooms, not the entire house. This limits damage if any single server gets compromised."
            },
            {
                question: "In MCP architecture, what is a <span class='concept-highlight'>tool</span>?",
                options: [
                    "A software application for building MCP servers",
                    "A specific function or capability that an MCP server exposes to AI clients",

                    "A configuration file that defines server settings"
                ],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "In MCP, a 'tool' is a specific capability that the server offers to AI clients. Think of it like a function in a programming library - for example, a file system MCP server might offer tools like 'read_file', 'write_file', and 'list_directory'. The AI can then invoke these tools to accomplish tasks."
            },
            {
                question: "What does <span class='concept-highlight'>stateful vs stateless</span> mean for MCP servers?",
                options: [
                    "Stateful servers remember previous interactions, stateless servers treat each request independently",
                    "Stateful servers are faster, stateless servers are more secure",
                    "Stateful servers work locally, stateless servers work remotely",
                    "Stateful servers use HTTP, stateless servers use SSE"
                ],
                correct: 0,
                explanation: "A stateful server is like having a conversation with someone who remembers what you talked about earlier. A stateless server is like talking to someone with amnesia who treats each question as brand new. Most traditional MCP servers are stateless, but Cloudflare's Durable Objects enable stateful servers that can maintain context across multiple interactions."

            {
                question: "Why is <span class='concept-highlight'>JSON serialization</span> important in MCP communication?",
                options: [
                    "It compresses data to save bandwidth",
                    "It converts data structures into a format that can be transmitted over networks",
                    "It encrypts sensitive information automatically",
                    "It validates that all data is correct"
                ],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "JSON serialization is like packaging. When you ship a complex item, you need to pack it in a standard format that can be transported and then unpacked at the destination. JSON serialization converts complex data structures (objects, arrays, etc.) into text format that can travel over networks, then be reconstructed on the other side."

                question: "What is the purpose of <span class='concept-highlight'>CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)</span> in web-based MCP servers?",
                options: [
                    "To speed up network communications",
                    "To allow web browsers to access resources from different domains safely",
                    "To automatically handle user authentication",
                    "To compress data for faster transmission"
                ],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "CORS is like a security guard at a building who checks if visitors from other companies are allowed to enter. Web browsers block requests between different domains by default for security. CORS headers tell the browser 'it's okay for this specific domain to access this resource', enabling controlled cross-domain communication."

                    "A person who maintains the server hardware",
                    "A lightweight serverless function that runs at Cloudflare's edge locations",
                    "A background process that monitors server health",

                ],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "A Cloudflare Worker is like a smart assistant stationed at post offices around the world. Instead of having one central server, your code runs at many edge locations close to users. When someone makes a request, the nearest 'assistant' handles it, making responses faster and more reliable."

                    "Authentication verifies who you are, authorization determines what you can do",
                    "Authentication encrypts data, authorization compresses it",
                    "Authentication works locally, authorization works remotely",
                    "Authentication is for servers, authorization is for clients"
                ],
                correct: 0,
                explanation: "Authentication is like showing your ID at a club (proving who you are), while authorization is like the bouncer checking if you're on the VIP list (determining what you can access). In MCP servers, authentication confirms the user's identity, then authorization decides which tools they can use and what data they can access."

                    "Multiple servers are always faster than single servers",
                    "Each server can have focused permissions and be easier to maintain",
                    "Multiple servers use less memory",
                    "Single servers don't work with modern AI systems"
                ],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "It's like having specialized tools instead of one giant Swiss Army knife. A file management server only needs file system access, while a database server only needs database access. This separation makes each server simpler to build, test, and secure. If one server has a security issue, it doesn't compromise everything else."
